        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p> There are four groups of South American camelids, each with its own unique characteristics, which offer fibres that help to 
            enhance the rich tradition of Peruvian textiles. They are alpaca, llama, guanaco and vicu√±a. If you aren't familiar with these sorts 
            of animals, then you can't really tell the differences. However, there are a lot of differences between these animals. For example, 
                some are short, some are tall. Some are brown, some are white. Some are skinny, some are chubby. Some are domesticated, 
                some are wild. Camelids are all large, strictly herbivorous animals with slender necks and long legs. </p>
                
            <p>The South American forms range in weight from 35 kg to almost 100 kg. Old World camels, however, are much larger, weighing 450 to 
            650 kg. Camelids vary in body shape from slender to stocky, but all have long, gracile necks; a small head; and long, slender legs. 
            The upper lip is deeply and distinctively cleft. As we all know, we use sheep wool to make clothing for the winter or cute sweaters 
            and items! Instead of shee wool, in this shop, we produce thread, yarn and fiber from camelids animals. Fiber can be used for apparel 
            (such as socks, sweaters, accessories, shawls, coats, and suits) and home fashion (such as blankets and throws). 
            </p>
            <p>The earliest camelids evolved in North America, where they flourished for forty to fifty million years, with the last known North American camelids disappearing only 
                around 10,000 years ago.  Three to four million years ago, camelids that would give rise to the current day South American 
                species spread south across the Panamanian Land Bridge. Because of their their ability to thrive under tough conditions of 
                extreme temperature and scarce food and water, domesticated camelids have been extremely important to the development of 
                human cultures in the steppes of Eurasia, the deserts of Africa, and the arid Andes of South America. All camelids are diurnal 
                and are adapted to harsh and dry climates. They are all highly social.

                        <li id="lol"> Vicuna </li>
            <p id="h2"> The Vicuna is the smallest and rarest of the South American camelids, and is considered to have the finest animal 
                        fiber in the world. Becaused of its fine fiber, Vicuna's were driven to extincgtion. Various conservation programs 
                        have ensured survival of the Vicuna, and this wonderful fibre is once again available to the textile industry. There 
                        are now approximately 150,000 Vicunas in South America, about 80% of which inhabit Peru.</p>

                        <li id="lo"> Guanaco </li>
            <p id="h3"> The Guanaco, like the Vicuna, is a wild camelid that lives in big groups of males or small bands of females led by 
            a dominant male. There are approximately 600,000 Guanacos in South America and about 80% of them are found in Patagonia, Argentina. 
            The extremely high quality of Guanaco fiber can be discerned simply by touch. its fibre is a reddish shade. Guanacos are the only South 
            American camelid that adapt easily to different environments. </p>

                <li id="ol"> Alpaca </li>
            <p id="h4"> The Alpaca is indigenous to the Peruvian highlands. There are an estimated four million Alpacas in South America. There are 
            two Alpaca types: Huacayo, the predominant Alpaca type known by its fine and bulky fleece, which offers the widest range of natural shades, 
            and Suri, the least predominant Alpaca type known by its long, curly, shiny and silky fibre.</p>

                <div class="col-md"
            <p id="h5"> The Llama is the heaviest and largest South American camelid. Its long legs as well as its prominent and crooked ears distinguish 
            the llama from the other camelids.Llamas have been domesticated and used as beasts of burden since Pre-Incan times. Even today, Llamas are part
            of the many customs and religious rituals of the Andean people. Llama hair is coarser than alpaca hair. However, if dehaired, it can be as soft 
            as alpaca. </p>
