            <p> There are four groups of South American camelids, each with its own unique characteristics, which offer fibres that help to 
            enhance the rich tradition of Peruvian textiles. They are alpaca, llama, guanaco and vicuña. If you aren't familiar with these sorts 
            of animals, then you can't really tell the differences. However, there are a lot of differences between these animals. For example, 
                some are short, some are tall. Some are brown, some are white. Some are skinny, some are chubby. Some are domesticated, 
                some are wild. As we all know, we use sheep wool to make clothing for the winter or cute sweaters and items! Instead of shee wool, in 
                this shop, we produce thread, yarn and fiber from camelids animals. he earliest camelids evolved in North America, 
                where they flourished for forty to fifty million years, with the last known North American camelids disappearing only 
                around 10,000 years ago.  Three to four million years ago, camelids that would give rise to the current day South American 
                species spread south across the Panamanian Land Bridge. Because of their their ability to thrive under tough conditions of 
                extreme temperature and scarce food and water, domesticated camelids have been extremely important to the development of 
                human cultures in the steppes of Eurasia, the deserts of Africa, and the arid Andes of South America. All camelids are diurnal 
                and are adapted to harsh and dry climates. They are all highly social. Camelids are large, strictly herbivorous animals with 
                slender necks and long legs.

            <p id="h2"> The Vicuna is the smallest and rarest of the South American camelids, and is considered to have the finest animal 
                        fiber in the world. Becaused of its fine fiber, Vicuna's were driven to extincgtion. Various conservation programs 
                        have ensured survival of the Vicuña, and this wonderful fibre is once again available to the textile industry. There 
                        are now approximately 150,000 Vicuñas in South America, about 80% of which inhabit Peru.</p>
